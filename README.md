# 🚀 Mini Mission Control Center (Frontend Demo)

## 🌍 Overview
**MissionHub Frontend Demo** is a mini version of a Mission Control Center (MCC) dashboard — designed to showcase the integration between **real-time monitoring**, **AI-powered anomaly detection**, and an intuitive **frontend interface**.

This demo focuses on the **frontend experience**, presenting a clean and interactive dashboard built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**.  
It visualizes mission data in real-time and highlights anomalies detected by the AI system.
